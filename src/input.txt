Now we will talk about Exception Handling.
Here in this program, we have kept it simple so nothing much to worry about here, however, we do take the nawe from the user.
The array we use to store the nawe is of size 30. What will happen if user enters a string that is more than 30 in length? This would result in a buffer overflow. This may crash your program right away or produce unexpected results.Ðøp
To avoid this either we can write a function that would get a string from the stdin one by one and stops if Enter is pressed or if string is more than 30 OR we can use the inbuilt function known as fgets.
Thanks!
